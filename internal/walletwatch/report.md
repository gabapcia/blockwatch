## Key Findings

### 1. Performance Scaling
- **V2 wins on small datasets** but **V1 wins on large datasets**
- V1 shows better scaling characteristics as dataset size increases
- The performance gap widens in favor of V1 as data volume grows

### 2. Memory Allocation Patterns
- **V1 consistently makes fewer allocations** across all dataset sizes
- V2's pointer-based approach increases allocation overhead
- Allocation difference grows from 9% to 37% as datasets get larger

### 3. Memory Usage
- Similar memory usage on small/medium datasets
- **V1 uses 7% less memory on large datasets**
- V2's optimization attempts actually hurt memory efficiency at scale

## Technical Analysis

### V1 Implementation Characteristics
```go
// Uses direct Set values in DefaultMap
transactionsByWallet = types.NewDefaultMap[string](func() types.Set[string] { 
    return types.NewSet[string]() 
})
```
- Direct value storage reduces pointer overhead
- Simpler memory layout
- Better cache locality

### V2 Implementation Characteristics
```go
// Uses pointer to Set in DefaultMap
transactionsByWallet = types.NewDefaultMap[string](func() *types.Set[string] {
    s := types.NewSet[string]()
    return &s
})
```
- Pointer indirection adds overhead
- Additional allocations for pointer management
- Capacity hints don't offset the pointer overhead cost

## Recommendation

### **Use V1 (getTransactionsByWallet)**

**Primary Reasons:**
1. **Better Production Performance**: Large datasets are more representative of real-world blockchain processing
2. **Memory Efficiency**: 25-37% fewer allocations reduce GC pressure
3. **Scalability**: Performance characteristics improve relative to V2 as data grows
4. **Simplicity**: Cleaner implementation without unnecessary optimizations

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Slightly slower on very small datasets (acceptable given production context)
- Missing theoretical optimizations that don't materialize in practice

## Updated Key Findings

### 1. Performance Scaling at Solana Scale
- **V2 maintains speed advantage** even at realistic blockchain scales (25k transactions)
- V2 is consistently 1-4% faster across all Solana-scale scenarios
- **However, V1 still wins on memory efficiency** with 41-49% fewer allocations

### 2. Memory Allocation Patterns at Scale
- **V1's allocation advantage becomes more pronounced** at larger scales
- V2 makes 41-49% more allocations at Solana scale vs 25-37% at smaller scales
- The allocation overhead gap widens as the number of watched wallets increases

### 3. Memory Usage Trends
- V2 uses 1.4-2.7% more memory at Solana scale
- Memory overhead is consistent but not dramatic
- V1 maintains better memory efficiency across all scenarios

## Revised Technical Analysis

### Real-World Performance Characteristics
At Solana scale (25k transactions, 50k addresses):
- **Speed**: V2 is 1-4% faster consistently
- **Memory**: V1 uses 1-3% less memory
- **Allocations**: V1 makes 41-49% fewer allocations

### Production Considerations
1. **GC Pressure**: V1's 41-49% fewer allocations significantly reduce garbage collection pressure
2. **Memory Efficiency**: V1's lower allocation count is more important than V2's small speed gains
3. **Scalability**: V1's allocation advantage grows with dataset size
4. **Consistency**: V1 shows more predictable memory patterns

## Updated Recommendation

### **Still Use V1 (getTransactionsByWallet)**

**Revised Reasoning:**
1. **GC Performance**: 41-49% fewer allocations at Solana scale will significantly reduce GC pressure in production
2. **Memory Efficiency**: V1 uses less memory and makes fewer allocations consistently
3. **Production Stability**: Lower allocation count leads to more predictable performance under load
4. **Cost-Benefit**: V2's 1-4% speed improvement doesn't justify 41-49% more allocations

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- 1-4% slower execution time (minimal impact)
- Missing theoretical speed optimizations that come at too high an allocation cost

## Conclusion

The Solana-scale benchmarks **reinforce the original recommendation**. While V2 shows consistent speed improvements (1-4%), V1's **dramatic allocation efficiency advantage (41-49% fewer allocations)** makes it the clear choice for production blockchain processing.

In high-throughput blockchain environments, **garbage collection pressure from excessive allocations** is a more critical performance bottleneck than small execution time differences. V1's allocation efficiency will provide better sustained performance under continuous load.

**Final Decision: Retain getTransactionsByWallet (V1) and remove getTransactionsByWalletV2 (V2).**
